# DSA_Sorting_Algorithm
## Notes for team's memebers
### Constants for all program
#### Constants for datatype
    1. type_rand = 0 for Randomized data
    2. type_sorted = 1 for-sorted data
    3. type_rev = 2 for reverse-sorted data
    4. type_nsorted = 3 for nearly-sorted data
#### Constants for running mode
    1. algorithm_mode = "-a" for mode 1
    2. compare_mode = "-c" for mode 2
#### Constants for parameter
    1. _p_time = "-time" Only print the running time
    2. _p_comp = "-comp" Only print the number of comparisions.
    3. _p_both = "-both" Print both of them
### Running mode
    In this project, we have two mode.
        1. Run one-sorting algorithm and required to calculate the running time and the comparisions for each algorithm.
        2. Run two-sorting algoritm and compare
### Coding
    1. You will buil your algorithms which assigned before in-sort.h and-sort.pp
    2. We will develop one function to choice algoritm from command and run it. (We will have 11-sorting algorithm).
## How to use this program?
    This program use command line in cmd to run. There're five command line.
    1. [Execution file] -a [Algorithm] [Given input] [Output parameter(s)]
    2. [Execution file] -a [Algorithm] [Input size] [Input order] [Output parameter(s)]
    3. [Execution file] -a [Algorithm] [Input size] [Output parameter(s)]
    4. [Execution file] -a [Algorithm] [Input size] [Output parameter(s)]
    5. [Execution file] -c [Algorithm 1] [Algorithm 2] [Input size] [Input order]

    [Given input] is a path to input file
